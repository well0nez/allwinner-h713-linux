# Display: how a picture reaches the imager

The projector's optics are fed by a **MIPS32 co-processor**, not by the ARM cores. Linux owns one block
of the chain and asks the co-processor for the rest. Knowing where that line runs explains most of what
looks strange about this SoC.

## Who owns what

| Owner | Block | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| ARM (Linux) | AFBD at `0x05600000` | feeds the video plane from the capture ring, writes the VidDec descriptor |
| MIPS (`display.bin`) | capture (INCAP `0x06940000`), window chain, scaler, panel output | everything between the source and the imager |

The ARM *can* read and even write the MIPS-owned registers. It does not help: without the firmware's own
recalculation the write is either ignored or harmful. Measured - a 960×540 processing window at 1080p
changes nothing on screen, and hand-resetting the scaler after a firmware rebuild does not bring back a
doubled image. The only lever that works is making the firmware recompute.

## Bring-up order

1. **U-Boot** loads `display.bin` plus the panel tables, reserves the SMM heap the firmware allocates
   from, and starts the MIPS (`h713_disp init`). Without the heap, the firmware's `SetSource` dereferences
   a null pointer and takes the ARM down with it - that cost three sessions to find.
2. **Linux** binds `sun50i-h713-afbd`, which registers a KMS device (`card1`): one CRTC with `GAMMA_LUT`
   and `CTM`, one plane that scans out the HDMI capture ring, and an `aspect` property for letter- and
   pillarboxing.
3. **`h713-tv`** puts the capture ring on the plane, and the framebuffer console back when the signal
   disappears.

The panel timings live in the vendor tables, not in a device tree: `h713_project` selects the
`ProjectID_0x*.TSE` group, and the artifacts come from the `hy310-boot` partition by name, so renumbering
partitions cannot break them.

## What the KMS device gives you

Anything that can draw on DRM/KMS works - `modetest`, a compositor, mpv. The shipped image runs `h713-tv`
instead of a desktop because the projector's job here is the HDMI input, but nothing prevents a
compositor from taking `card1`.

Gamma and white balance are ordinary CRTC properties, computed from the vendor picture tables by
[`h713-pq`](../tools/h713-pq.md); they are not baked into the driver.

## Limits, honestly

- The plane reads the capture ring **directly** rather than importing a dma-buf. Functionally equivalent
  for this use, marked "transitional" in the driver, and the reason the display path and the HDMI input
  are more coupled than they should be.
- The picture geometry is whatever the firmware decides. We can ask for a different aspect handling; we
  cannot place an arbitrary window.
- There is **no HDMI output** on this device. The imager is the only display.

(gamma/CTM), `doku/40-display.md` (bring-up history), `doku/74` (the null-pointer crash).
